Static methods are defined using the \"@staticmethod\" decorator.\n",

For example, the \"init\" method is called when an instance of a class is created, and is used to initialize the instance's attributes. The \"str\" method is used to define how an instance of a class is converted to a string, and is often used for debugging purposes. There are many other special methods that can be used in Python."
