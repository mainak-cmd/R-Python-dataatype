    "There are several types of neural networks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN): This is the most basic type of neural network, where data flows only in one direction, from input to output. These networks are used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): These networks are commonly used for image recognition tasks. They use convolutional layers to extract features from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): These networks are used for tasks that involve sequential data, such as time-series analysis and language modeling. They use feedback loops to process and store information from previous time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: These are a type of RNN that are specifically designed to handle long-term dependencies. They are commonly used in natural language processing and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders: These networks are used for unsupervised learning, where the goal is to learn a compressed representation of the input data. They are commonly used for tasks such as image compression and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These networks are used for generating new data that is similar to the training data. They consist of a generator network that generates the data, and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish between the generated data and the real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning Networks: These networks are used for teaching agents how to make decisions in a dynamic environment. They receive rewards for making good decisions and punishments for making bad ones."
